# `teamgen`, a universal _Final Six_ generator

A tool for generating a random, progressively sound party of six Pokémon for use in a Pokémon playthrough.

I wanted this to be **universal** so it can maintain compatibility with most generations of Pokémon, but also romhacks that contain:
    
- New Pokémon
- New locations 
- Changes to existing games

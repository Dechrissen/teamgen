## Introduction
I wanted this tool to be **universal**. In that sense, it maintains compatibility with most generations of Pokémon, 
but also with romhacks that might contain:
- New Pokémon
- New locations 
- Changes to existing game data (evolution methods, etc.)

## Currently supported games
- **Vanilla**
  - Pokémon Red & Blue
- **Romhacks**
  - [Pokémon Solus RGB](https://github.com/Dechrissen/poke-solus-rgb)

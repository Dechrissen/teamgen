## Dexelect – Progression-aware Pokémon Team Generator

Dexelect is a tool for generating (or prescribing) a random, progression-faithful team of Pokémon for acquisition and use in a challenge playthrough. Customization options are available to curate the output party.

## Introduction
Dexelect generates (or prescribes) a **progression-faithful** party for use in a playthrough — either to introduce an element of 
challenge or simply for team inspiration. See the [suggested rulesets](/docs/RULESETS.md) for some ideas about how to use Dexelect.

The app is **universal** in that it maintains compatibility with most generations of Pokémon games, 
_and_ with romhacks that contain changes to game data, such as:

- Pokémon
- Evolution methods
- Locations

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to add support for a romhack.

### Implementation quirks
- <details>
  <summary><b>Munchlax trees</b> <i>(click to show/hide)</i></summary>

  In Diamond/Pearl/Platinum, [Munchlax trees](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Honey_Tree#Munchlax_trees) are a special case to handle. A random 4/21 total Honey Trees in the game are upgraded to special Munchlax trees in which Munchlax can be encountered 1% of the time. The locations are dependent on Trainer ID and secret ID, so there's no way to know where they are until finding them in a new file. This means there is no reliable point in the game to use as the acquisition point for Munchlax, and the party balance stats will not be 100% accurate. The solution I settled on for Dexelect (since it uses a sphere progression system) was to _assume that Munchlax trees are accessible in Sphere 3_, since by that point in the game, the probability of having access to at least one of the 4 Munchlax trees is 91% (up from 77% in Sphere 2 and 0% in Sphere 1) which seemed like a high enough probability to rely on for calculating party balance stats.

## Installation

### Option 1: Download (Windows/Linux)
<details>
  <summary><i>Click to show/hide</i></summary>

1. [Download](https://github.com/Dechrissen/dexelect/releases/latest) and extract `dexelect-<version>-<platform>.zip`
2. Run `dexelect.exe` on Windows, or `./dexelect` on Linux
3. **Linux only** (optional): After extracting, run `./install.sh` to register Dexelect with your app launcher. You can then delete the downloaded folder. To update, repeat these steps with the new version (the old one will be overwritten).
</details>

### Option 2: Build the binary (Windows/Linux)
<details>
  <summary><i>Click to show/hide</i></summary>

- **Build only** (Windows/Linux):
`git clone https://github.com/Dechrissen/dexelect.git && cd dexelect && ./scripts/build.sh`. Output binary will be in `dist/dexelect/` (run `./dexelect` on Linux; `dexelect.exe` on Windows).
- **Build and install to register Dexelect with your app launcher** (Linux): `git clone https://github.com/Dechrissen/dexelect.git && cd dexelect && ./scripts/build.sh && cd dist/dexelect && ./install.sh`

See the [build instructions](/docs/BUILD.md) for more details.
</details>

### Option 3: Run from source (terminal)
<details>
  <summary><i>Click to show/hide</i></summary>
Requires Python 3.11+.

1. `git clone https://github.com/Dechrissen/dexelect.git`
2. `cd dexelect`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (virtual environment recommended)
4. (Optional) `python main.py --fetch-sprites` to enable sprite display in the GUI
5. `python main.py` to run the GUI (optionally add `--ui=cli` for CLI or `--ui=web` for local Flask web app)

Run `python main.py --help` for available flags.
</details>

## Usage

### Using the GUI app
<details>
  <summary><i>Click to show/hide</i></summary>

- The app is split into sidebar (left) and main window (right). Help option is at the top right.
- Left sidebar:
  - The mode can be switched between 'Progression', 'Random (Obtainable)', and 'Random (National Dex)'
  - Party size can be adjusted (1–6)
  - 'Acquisition Details', 'HM Coverage', and 'Balance Stats' display can each be toggled on or off
  - 'Export Party' button exports party to `.txt` file
- Main window:
  - 'Generate', 'Spheres', and 'Config' tabs at the top can be switched between
  - Click 'Generate Party' (or press Enter) to generate a team
  - Change sphere mode and view per-sphere location lists in the 'Spheres' tab
  - Modify settings in the 'Config' tab to customize output party restrictions

</details>

### Using the web app
<details>
  <summary><i>Click to show/hide</i></summary>

Visit the [live Dexelect web app](https://dexelect.derekandersen.net). 

Alternatively, run `python main.py --ui=web` and visit the `url:port` shown in your terminal.

The web app is organized into a main header (with Game selector and 'Generate Party' button) and tabs for navigation.
- Click 'Generate Party' to generate a team
- Tabs
  - **Party** – Where the generated party will be displayed
  - **Setup** – For changing global settings (generation mode, party size, etc.)
  - **Spheres** – For changing sphere modes and viewing per-sphere location lists 
  - **Config** – For modifying settings to customize output party restrictions
  - **Help** – Display the help dialog
</details>

### Using the CLI app
<details>
  <summary><i>Click to show/hide</i></summary>

Run `python main.py --ui=cli`.

- `ENTER` – Generate a team with the current settings
- `G` – Open the 'Supported Games' menu to switch current game
- `M` – Open the 'Generation Mode' menu to change the team generation mode
- `P` – Open the 'Set Party Size' menu to set party size (1–6)
- `R` – Reload the config file from disk (after making any config changes while the app is running)
- `H` – Display help menu
- `Q` – Quit the app

#### Modifying config settings for the CLI app
Open `/config/config_gen1.yaml` (for Gen 1 games for instance). Modify values according to your preferences. 
Save the file and then, if the app was running, use the `R` option in the app to reload.

## Disclaimer on LLM usage

_TLDR_: The GUI front-ends were bootstrapped using an LLM. The rest of the code is human-written.

The core of this project (i.e., `core.py` logic and functions, data file format, data structures, classes) was **neither designed nor authored by an LLM**.

The GUI front-ends (`Tk` GUI, Flask web app) were bootstrapped using an LLM; as such, the LLM-authored directories in this project are `ui/gui/` and `ui/web/`. (The command-line UI in `ui/cli.py` is the original, human-authored UI, and it can be invoked with the flag `--ui=cli`.)

For continued development, data curation for the per-game data files in `data/` is partially carried out with an LLM (web scraping, formatting, etc.).

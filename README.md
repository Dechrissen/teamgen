## Introduction
_TeamGen_ generates (prescribes) a party for use in a playthrough — either to introduce an element of 
challenge or simply for team inspiration. 
The tool is **universal** in the sense that it maintains compatibility with _most_ generations of Pokémon, 
but also with romhacks that might contain the following (as long as the relevant game data files are added):
- New Pokémon
- New locations 
- Changes to existing game data (location data, evolution methods, etc.)

## Currently supported games
- **Vanilla**
  - Pokémon Red
  - Pokémon Blue
- **Romhacks**
  - [Pokémon Solus RGB](https://github.com/Dechrissen/poke-solus-rgb)

### Changing config settings
Open `/config/config_gen1.yaml` (for example, for Generation 1 games). Modify values according to your preferences. 
Save the file and then use the `R` option in the app to reload.

# TODO

- [ ] add a donation button, or github sponsor button (in readme?)
- post on reddit when done
- add to website/linkedin/portfolio
  - and solus webpage?

- write README
- make sure push for first release has "recommended settings" in config files
- test on actual linux

- add Yellow

- [ ] in progression yaml, figure out how to handle trade rooms as well -- when do u get access to them or how do u 
  keep track of that?
  - should they have values like "needs: onix, gets: mrmime" ?
  - probably just ignore the needed mon

- clean up CLI UI code and add some comments
- [ ] add comments/annotations to config and other yaml files, for users

- add comments to unit test functions

- make "gift" into "choice" for HITMONs?

- [ ] add "user defined modals" to the config, which are extra modals that get added to the modal list when doing 
  the check
  - e.g. "nidoran_m and nidoran_f"
  - jynx and mr.mime

- [ ] maybe change all the stuff in the config YAML to be lists, not yaml-coded lists with booleans. Would be better 
  for future-proofing when adding more acquisition methods?


- [ ] annotate the progression file so we know where certain things come from, e.g. the moon stone on route 2 can 
  only be gotten in sphere 2, so we should have a comment "from Route2 after Cut"

- [ ] Proper unit test suite

- [ ] add Pool class
- [ ] ? I think the config should maybe be a Config class. This would make it easier to validate and pass along to 
  functions

- [ ] Decide if adding stone evo validation

- add HM coverage output
  - list of HMs, check marks next to covered ones, or color them green

- check every location from locations is in meta spheres list (also add unit test for this?)

- add CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for adding data files for additional games


- add unit tests for party generation functions (define test parties)
